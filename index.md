STAT 548R is a seminar-style course based on reading, discussion, and collaborative learning exercises. The primary goal of the course is to prepare graduate students in Statistics ([and related fields](#target-audience)) to successfully navigate the challenges of the PhD program, with a particular emphasis on the skills and knowledge that are not part of the standard curriculum, often not discussed, and usually learned informally---if at all. 

The high-level themes of the course will manifest through sessions on:

1. Research skill-building (paper reading and critiquing/reviewing, written and verbal communication)
2. Soft-skill building (self-regulation and -expectations, managing advisor relationships, supporting your peers)
3. Academic culture and the production of knowledge (misconceptions about research, hidden curricula, power dynamics in scientific communities)
4. How research happens (research as a process, what counts as progress, the review process)

Class will meet weekly on Monday mornings. Statistics PhD students in the Qualifying Course will also meet on some Wednesday mornings for Qualifying Paper-specific sessions.

## Target Audience

The course is designed with new PhD students in Statistics in mind, but most of the main ideas apply to adjacent/overlapping fields (e.g., Computer Science, Mathematics, etc.), with the caveat that every academic community has its own codes, values, standard methods, etc. In fact, the course structure and many of the activities are adapted (and in many cases, used with no or only minor modifications) from a [course for new PhD students in Computer Science at Harvard](https://harvard-cs290-2025-26.github.io/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. This is all to say that students from other fields may benefit from the course, and the course will benefit from having students from other fields. Depending on the mix of disciplines of enrolled students, we may try to adapt some activities, with the main constraints being time, resources, and instructor knowledge. 

## Statistics PhD Qualifying Papers

This course is formally part of the [Qualifying Course (STAT 548A/B)](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/phd-qualifying-course){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} for PhD students. In class, we will focus on developing skills and knowledge that will help students indirectly on their Qualifying Papers (QPs). On most Wednesdays through October, there will be QP-specific sessions for Statistics students who are writing QPs. Please see the [schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule/) for details.
