**Pre-class work:** 

- Read a paper of your choosing (not your QP). Answer the questions on Canvas.
- Come to class prepared to describe in detail one of the paper's experiments and present your answers to the Canvas questions.


**In class:**

- [Designing and presenting computational experiments]({{ site.baseurl }}/readings/computational-experiments){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- Examples


**After class**

- If your QP has experiments/evaluation section(s), read it/them carefully. What is the purpose of each experiment?
- If you are doing experiments as part of your QP report, think and plan: What are you trying to convey with each experiment? How will you present it?
